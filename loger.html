<h1>Ode to Loger Taper Fade</h1>
<p>Logan walks with a rhythm all his own,</p>
<p>But you can call him Loger when the mood has grown.</p>
<p>Smooth as a breeze on a cool spring parade,</p>
<p>They whisper Loger-Taper-Fade, crisp as a fade.</p>
<br>
<p>When the world gets loud, and the crowd starts to sway,</p>
<p>He slips into the shadows, Lo-key all the way.</p>
<p>A quiet force, like thunder in sleep,</p>
<p>Carrying secrets the wild wind keep.</p>
<br>
<p>But to those who know him, and call him a friend,</p>
<p>It’s Logee, the name that softens the end.</p>
<p>A laugh in the dark, a spark in the cold,</p>
<p>A story of courage that's yet to be told.</p>
<br>
<p>By many names, he dances through days,</p>
<p>A chameleon soul in a sun-dappled haze.</p>
<p>Logan, Loger, or Lo-Key in shade,</p>
<p>You’ll always remember Loger-Taper-Fade.</p>
